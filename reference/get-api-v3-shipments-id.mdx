Location where the package is picked up.  
Depending on the flow you choose,  
you must send different parameters.

A location is a geographical point that can be taken as the origin and/or destination of a shipment.

There are 3 ways in which you can define a location, feel free to choose the one that best suits your business rules.  
Each one is described below.

1.  Coords-based  
    It is the option with the best precision to define an origin or destination.  
    Latitude and longitude are taken to define the location
    
2.  LocationId-based  
    A LocationId is a uuid that identifies a single geographic point.  
    The locationId is generated by this API (check out the Get Location id request in Locations folder).  
    By using locationId, no further data needs to be passed.  
    It is useful when you have the same point in several shipments since you can reuse the locationId.
    
3.  Address string-based  
    In this option the client sends only the address. We will process the address to obtain the other data.
    

However, if the address does not contain information necessary to locate it,  
the system will return a 400 error and the order will not be created, so you must handle the error.

It is important to emphasize that in the two previous flows there is no possibility to reject an order for the location
